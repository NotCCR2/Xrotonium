# ‚ù§Ô∏è For Skidders
This one is mainly for you, N17Pro3426.

I solely put the source code here to teach people the basics of GDI, instead of opening a portal for skidders, so I put a GPL v3.0 licence.

That way, if you use this malware's source code, you are obligated to release the source code of your project and set the same licence.
